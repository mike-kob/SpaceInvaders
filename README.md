# SpaceInvaders

The point of the game is to score as many points as you can. The levels go on for ever with the steady growth of complexity till the certain point.
The score is recorded, if you want. You can see the results in leaderboard from the main menu.

The game is written in Java and we used Swing library to create GUI.
